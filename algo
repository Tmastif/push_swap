push 2 from a to b


current maximun of stack b
current minimum of stack b

every num of stack a to check
is it gonna be max or min in stack b?
if so - it should be placed on top the current max



if only 3 numbers are in stack a - dont push - do 3's sort

push back to a:
if the number on top of b wont be in requored position in a after pushed to a, we rotate a until its at the right position to be pushed
